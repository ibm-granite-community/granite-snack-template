    "# Contract Analysis using IBM Granite LLM from watsonx\n",
    "Author: [@Aisha Mohammed Farooq Darga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aisha-mohammed-farooq-darga-778280135/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Contract analysis involves reviewing, interpreting, and extracting key information from contract documents to identify risks, obligations, and critical aspects. This ensures clarity on terms and conditions, helps avoid ambiguities, and mitigates potential legal or financial complications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effective contract analysis is crucial for businesses, legal professionals, and stakeholders, as it safeguards against unintentional obligations, disputes, and risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Does This Notebook Do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an **automated solution for contract analysis** by leveraging advanced AI technologies like **IBM Granite LLM (`ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct`)** and **[Docling's DocumentConverter](https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/)**. It simplifies the process of extracting, analyzing, and understanding key details from contract documents, enabling users to:  \n",
    "- Identify important clauses and terms.  \n",
    "- Assess potential risks and obligations.  \n",
    "- Generate actionable insights for better decision-making.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is particularly useful for legal professionals, business analysts, and organizations handling contracts regularly, as it ensures consistency and scalability in the analysis process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach Followed**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Conversion**  \n",
    "   - Contracts in various file formats (e.g., PDFs) are converted into text using **Docling's DocumentConverter**, producing markdown-formatted text for seamless processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Splitting and Preparation**  \n",
    "   - Contracts are split into manageable text chunks to ensure efficient processing by the AI model and adherence to token limits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AI-Powered Analysis**  \n",
    "   - The **IBM Granite LLM (`ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct`)** processes the contract chunks using a carefully crafted prompt. It performs the following tasks:\n",
    "     - **Clause Identification**: Extracts and summarizes critical clauses, such as payment terms, intellectual property rights, and termination conditions.  \n",
    "     - **Risk Analysis**: Identifies potential risks, categorizes them by severity, and offers strategies to mitigate them.  \n",
    "     - **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggests improvements to contract terms and provides compliance checklists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Consolidation**  \n",
    "   - The results from each chunk are merged into a single comprehensive analysis document, offering both a high-level summary and detailed insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IBM Cloud Account**: [Sign up here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).\n",
    "- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.11.9 is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Environment Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **IBM Cloud Account Setup**\n",
    "- Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all).\n",
    "- Create a [watsonx.ai Project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=projects-creating-project).\n",
    "- Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
    "This step will open a Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Watson Machine Learning (WML) Service**\n",
    "- Create a [WML Service Instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) (Lite Plan recommended).\n",
    "- Generate an [API Key](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html).\n",
    "- Associate the WML service to the project that you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html).\n",
